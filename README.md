# 🚖 Ride Demand Forecasting using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **forecasting ride demand** using an Uber dataset with **1,50,000+ rows and 21 features**.  
The goal is to predict future demand trends and help in **efficient resource allocation** for ride-sharing businesses.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Encoded categorical features  
   - Engineered datetime-based features  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized demand patterns over time  
   - Correlation analysis to find key predictors  

3. **Model Building**  
   - Algorithms tested:  
     - Linear Regression (baseline)  
     - Random Forest  
     - Gradient Boosting  
     - XGBoost  
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

4. **Model Selection**  
   - Compared models using accuracy, RMSE, and interpretability  
   - **XGBoost** achieved the best performance
